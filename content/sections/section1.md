## About Cathay DDT Open Source Software

Cathay FHC established Digital, Data & Technology (DDT) in 2016. DDT regards “data-driven” as culture. With “Digital, Data, and Technology” as its three pillars, DDT builds the infrastructure for big data analysis and application, utilizes new technologies in financial operations to create a data ecosystem, and creates an environment for creative talent from diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, DDT is in hopes of making Cathay FHC become the leading brand in the domestic digital and data ecosystem, and assists Taiwan to take a leap onto the international stage through the digital transformation process.

DDT has recruited over 550 interdisciplinary talents to promote the digital transformation in the nearly four years since it was established. Utilizing group resources, DDT gathers strategic partners to collaborate with startups around the world in expanding overseas markets.
